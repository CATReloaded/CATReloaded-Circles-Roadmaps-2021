This road-map for android development that can help you to improve your skills with very recommended articles and other resources. 

**Before we start providing you with resources**..    
## :cyclone: What about android as operating system(OS): 

<p align="center">
  <img src="img/android2.jpeg" width="650" >
</p> 

Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software.   
**Designed for:**   
  
- Smartphones & Tablets :iphone:
- Tv :tv:
- Wear OS :watch:
- Android things :crystal_ball:

`First of all we should learn a programming language from [java or Kotlin] and XML [for building the user interface(UI)]`

## I recommend you to start with java as a programming language.. why? :sweat_smile:

- In my opinion most of apps built with java and if you worked somewhere at a company , how do you refactor or add new features to this app that built with java!
- Most of open source was written with java.
- There are much more Java tutorials and almost every solution for Android problems on pages like Stack Overflow from the last years have been written in Java. 
- Understanding the syntax of a language is one thing, but to actually build apps you have to learn how to use the different framework and library APIs. You have to learn what classes you have to use and which methods you have to call in the different phases of your app. And for this you need practice and a lot of examples you can refer to.

**`Don't worry Java is not going to be obsolete` :muscle:**  


## Learn java: (Due to 3 or 4 weeks)

2. Java OOP
// TODO add a good resource here.

-->
### Before moving to the next level be sure that you have a good knowledge about:   
- OOP.
- Looping (for - while - doWhile).
- Make a decision (if else - switch).
- Exception handling (try catch).
- Casting, static, final, generics.
- Using interface and abstraction and Anonynmous object.
- :point_right: **Build a simple project with java like ( Banking or Hotel or SuperMarket system)**.

`Now you are ready to start with android`

## Basic level:
Now you are ready to build user interface using xml and write some java code at android studio.

3. Android Basics: Multiscreen Apps​ ​ (due to 1 Month)   
https://mena.udacity.com/course/android-basics-multiscreen-apps--ud839   

After you have learned to use Relative and Linear layout.. there is another amazing thing called **Constraint layout** to build a responsive layout   
[check this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N4bCdyGcUc&list=PLrnPJCHvNZuA80lNWNCLICR3qYzhw3iPI)   

**`Go a head and build a project and use the tools that you learned in basic level`**

### After that you are ready to work with database and networking so..   

### Database in android:
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/rdatabase.png" width="450">
</p>   
In android world.. the database commes from different sources (Local & Remote).   

**Local:** We use shared preference and room database(based on sqllite).

**Remote:** We can use firebase or some thing called API.

**:point_right: `Don't Worry right now about that, we 'll provide you with useful resources to learn that`**

## Intermediate part 1: 
Before that you should learn an important view called recycle view.. Why?    
Most of android apps need to display a list of any type of data for users so the best way to handle that using recycler view.

Learn how to store data into your local database of your application by learning room database.   
#### :clipboard: Resources:
4. **TODO** Add a room db resources.

#### Now you need to learn some thing awesome called (Material design)
<p align="center">

## Advanced part 1:
Alright, you need to add some more features for your app like playing music, integrate google maps into your app, push notification and more..   
#### :clipboard: Resources:
